Sometimes we all have had time of stagnation or are commonly known as *comfort zones*, maybe all of these have not been volunteers (or maybe yes), but there is always a way out of them, this time a book for these challenges is not the exception, remember that this way we learn important lessons.The book that was mentioned before is divided into three parts, these are: *update, download and reset*, a very appropriate name a positive point for the author. The part one of the book consists of an introduction to the present that we have and how paradigms have been created that are difficult to eradicate quickly, for this it takes a force of will and besides being aware that a change is necessary.

> *"His character is essentially the sum of his habits; it's how you usually act" **Rick Warren***

Continuing with part two is in clear and simple words **"drop what you do not occupy, take what is necessary"**, individually you create an awareness of what is really important and prepare you for part three that in my opinion you occupy at least one month to complete each exercise. Finally, part three concludes with exercises with that philosophy of **"starts from scratch and in a good way"** is where the book has to take a practical and applicative sense, as is the reading exercises are presented to improve in those areas of opportunity that we have , I would like to mention some of them, but the best thing is that you discover it on your own, some of them will surprise you or perhaps you exercise them without realizing it.

> *"The mind is like a parachute. It does not work if not open" **Albert Einstein***

In my opinion I do not read books on this subject very often, but it was a challenge to finish it, for example, what I liked was finding those phrases referring to the topic that is being treated and an illustration referring to it. If you want to change your way of thinking, being and living in life, this book will be of great help, it is never too late to start to change course, but always remember to have well-defined goals together with that *willpower*.
