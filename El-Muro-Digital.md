But what is disruptive? When I started to see the cover of this book, I asked myself the same question, we could get it from a dictionary, but this is not the case, besides the message that is in the mouths of all *"The Wall"*. This book mentions the news of the *"Digital World"* together with statistics of these, not everything is there, it is possible to confront in a way all this future approaching, in the following lines I will talk about it.

The book starts describing a normal day in the digital age (like today we use **Uber** or some service), as well as all these changes we have had go unnoticed, where there is a world of possibilities to create, innovate and implement. Enter in context, the average person's attention on the Internet is very scarce being spent between a range of 3 to 4 hours a day, because there is an immensity of information, is difficult to focus on a subject without being distracted at a time, everything has to be precise and effective, so dear reader, the digital is part of our ecosystem and if we do not know how to adapt it can become contradictory in different aspects.

Remember that when you add digitization to an idea, processes or whatever, growth is created exponentially, we can observe it without a doubt, remember how it was before going to school your way of applying the **One Size Fits All**, And now as all this has changed?, educational online platforms are in their best time.
I must point out that I got this book after being present at the [Accenture event](https://www.accenture.com/mx-es/event-mexico-now-monterrey), which I was a participant in their workshops and presential conferences, this may be outside the review, but I would like to bring it as data for you.

On the other hand, the following phrase impressive for me, it is a call to action, **"We work too much to compensate for the lack of integration between activities in companies due to low investment in technology"**, this brings me to memory Pareto principle with its *80/20*, to be perfectly honest this is true, many of these processes can be automated, imagine a moment in those disruptive technologies that are still waiting to come to light by someone with an initiative in changing the direction (spoiler the book mentions them, this book is not to be missed) of things.

I finish with an author's sentence that says the following: **"In the times of transformation, the visionaries are those who think about the abundance that will come, and not in the scarcity"**, we now have more data than ever that need to be treated in the way Correct along with artificial intelligence in development, What do you expect from the future and how will you face it once you know this? Overall the decision remains in you.
