### :pushpin: Some extra details
Another book about innovation, you can find it with **ISBN 9788499924885.**

Innovation a concept that we know and is strongly linked to creativity, two concepts that play an important role in a global knowledge economy, different concepts and ideas were of great impact with this reading, divided into different chapters, bringing together the best of Latin as well as international talent in biographical capsules of their way of how they got to where they are, one important thing I have to say, several of them see failure as a prelude to success. Returning to the chapters each of them is dedicated to a leader or pioneer for example of gastronomy, drones, 3D printing, soccer, education, trips to the space and others related. All this with the purpose of how each of them came to those results. 

Here's a list of the characters you'll find in the book:
- Gastón Acurio
- Jordi Muñoz
- Bre Pettis
- Rafael Yuste
- Salman Khan
- Pep Guardiola
- and more!!

The chapter that had the most impact on me was that of Salman Khan, where his initiative began by uploading videos to YouTube to help a family member. Together in this chapter is where you introduce the terms of flipped schools and mastering learning. These are the bases of how the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) platform is built, which you should take a tour to discover the personalized education provided there.

Also the Brain Drain effect is mentioned in the book that it comes to turn into a Circulation of Brains (when applied correctly), where some Latin American countries have made their efforts to have this talent that is needed in the industry, giving economic incentives to go to study abroad, thus giving a possibility of being reciprocal with the institutions in their native country, thus generating a cycle benefits for both sides. Finally the place, the environment with the culture of the people will always give way to characters that carry inside innovation. 

I add that although time passes the content is very enriching with respect to the above, I would never have known that there is a [World Giving Index](https://www.cafonline.org/) if I had not read such a text. If you want to know more about the 5 secrets of innovation in the same way that different little interviews of how the list leaders mentioned achieved a culture of innovation, this book is for you.
